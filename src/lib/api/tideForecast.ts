// Note: In a production environment, you would want to:
// 1. Set up a server to scrape tide-forecast.com
// 2. Cache the results for each day
// 3. Update the cache once per day
// 4. Serve the cached data to clients
// This would give you accurate data without hitting rate limits or dealing with CORS issues
